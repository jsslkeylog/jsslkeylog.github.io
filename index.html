<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>jSSLKeyLog is a Java Agent Library that logs SSL session keys of
connections created by a Java application to a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NSS_Key_Log_Format">log
file understood by Wireshark</a>, so that "Follow SSL stream" can be
used to debug SSL connection issues as if the connection was not
encrypted. It works with both Java server and client software.</p>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>A Java Runtime environment 1.7 or above is needed. You can get it
from <a href="https://java.com/">Java.com</a>. In case you want to use it with Java 1.5
or 1.6, use version 1.1 of this program instead. The agent library was
tested with Java 1.7 to 15; as it accesses internal API directly,
it might not work in more recent versions without updating.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>First download jSSLKeyLog and extract it.</p>
<p>Locate the command line used to start the Java program (usually hidden in some
script or batch file) you want to monitor, it will usually look like <br />
<tt>java ... -jar file.jar ...</tt> or <tt>java ... some.class.Name ... </tt>.</p>
<p>Now add an additional parameter directly after the <tt>java</tt> command name, which
is <tt>-javaagent:jSSLKeyLog.jar=/path/to/your_logfile.log</tt>, so that the complete
command looks like this:<br />
<tt>java -javaagent:jSSLKeyLog.jar=/path/to/your_logfile.log ... -jar file.jar
...</tt></p>
<p>You can give an absolute or relative path to jSSLKeyLog.jar and to your logfile.</p>

<p>If you use a double <tt>==</tt> between name of the Jar file and the name of
your log file, extra verbose comments (containing timestamps and
local/remote host/ip) will be written before the individual entries.</p>

<p>The logfile will be written while the program is running. Now just point Wireshark
to that logfile and happy SSL decoding!</p>

<p>Note that for decoding ECDSA ciphers, at least Wireshark 1.11.3 is required.</p>
